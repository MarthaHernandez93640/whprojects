                <p>Hey everyone, My name is Martha Hernandez and I am a full time student and mom of three girls. I have some pets you probably dont want to hear about but I am going to talk about them none the less, haha. I have a husky and two cats all female as well. I am currently finishing up my AS in Computer Information Systems, and I hope to get a job working as a Network Administrator or something similar. I am hoping Bitwise can help me learn some new things and maybe change my mind on a career path or at least open my eyes to a new one. I look forward to working with everyone the rest of the phase.</p>
